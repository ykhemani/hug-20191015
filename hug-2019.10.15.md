# HashiCorp Users Group Meetup - 2019-10-15

Notes from the demo for this meetup.

## Prequisites
1. Vault cluster running and unsealed. Can be run locally or in Cloud. For example, via https://github.com/ykhemani/vault-guides/tree/master/operations/aws-kms-unseal/terraform-aws

1. Environment variables.
  - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  - `AWS_REGION`

---

## Configure AWS Secrets Engine

1. Disable secrets engine at the `aws/` path if already enabled.

```
vault secrets disable aws
```

1. Enable AWS secrets engine at `aws/` path.

```
vault secrets enable -path=aws aws
```

1. Configure AWS Secrets engine.

```
vault write aws/config/root \
  access_key=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} \
  secret_key=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} \
  region=${AWS_REGION}
```

1. Create role `tfe-aws` and specify policy that allows all actions on ec2 resources.
```
vault write aws/roles/tfe-aws \
  credential_type=iam_user \
  policy_document=-<<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1426528957000",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

---

## Demo dynamic secrets

1. Show [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/users) as you do this.

  - filter for vault-root-tfe-aws

1. Retrieve secrets

```
vault read aws/creds/tfe-aws
```

1. Revoke lease for the secrets issued above.

```
vault lease revoke <lease_id>
```

---

## Show Terraform using AppRole Auth Method to retrieve secrets.

1. Disable auth methods already enable at path `approle/`.

```
vault auth disable approle
```

1. Configure AppRole Auth Method

```
vault auth enable -path=approle approle
```

1. Create Role `tfe-vault` and assign policy `tfe-vault`.

```
vault write auth/approle/role/tfe-vault policies="tfe-vault"
```

1. Create policy `tfe-vault` that will enable us to read the aws secrets defined above, as well as to create short lived tokens.

```
vault policy write tfe-vault - <<EOF
path "aws/creds/tfe-aws" {
  capabilities = [ "read" ]
}

path "auth/token/create" {
  capabilities = [ "update" ]
}
EOF
```

1. Pull `role-id` and `secret-id` to populate in Terraform variables.

```
vault read -format=json auth/approle/role/tfe-vault/role-id | jq -r .data.role_id

vault write -format=json -f auth/approle/role/tfe-vault/secret-id | jq -r .data.secret_id
```

## Run Terraform

```
terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply
```

In AWS Console, filter for `vault-token-terraform-tfe-aws`.
